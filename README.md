# Cards-Against-Humanity
Terminal implementation of Cards Against Humanity in Python

Run CAH.py to start the game. Includes very rudimentary chat client between players, opened automatically by the game. Runinterminal.sh is a BASH script that enables this functionality on MacOS. (Hacks!)

Compatible and tested on Windows, Mac, Linux. Chat only available on Windows and Mac.

Add your own question and answer cards easily to the questioncards.txt and answercards.txt files. Blanks in question cards will automatically be detected.
